# Building-Simple-Serverless-Registration-WebApp

The simple serverless registration system in AWS leverages API Gateway, Lambda functions (coded in Python), and DynamoDB. API Gateway acts as the entry point for registration requests, invoking Lambda functions to handle the logic. Lambda functions written in Python validate and process the registration data, storing it in DynamoDB for persistence. This serverless architecture offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for handling user registrations without managing traditional server infrastructure.
